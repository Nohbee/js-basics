6. In a statically typed programming language, a variable's type must be explicitly defined at the time of definition and cannot be modified later. Accordingly, a variable that has been defined as an integer cannot be changed to a string or any other type. Since type mistakes are caught at build time, before the program is executed, statically typed languages are thought to be more effective and secure. C, Java, C++, and Swift are a few examples of programming languages using statically typed data.

On the other hand, a dynamically typed language is a sort of type checking where a variable's type is decided at runtime and is changeable while the program is being executed. In languages with dynamic typing, a variable's type is established by the value that is assigned to it. It enables more fast prototyping and a laxer approach to coding, making it more flexible and user-friendly. This, however, may potentially result in type mistakes that are not discovered until runtime. Programming languages with dynamic typing include JavaScript, Python, Ruby, and PHP.

7. Null is referred to as an empty value . You assign a null value to a variable with the understanding that it presently has no value but will do so in the future. It functions like a blank space for a value. The object is the null type. Null could sometimes be as a result of errors in code.

On the other hand, a variable is undefined when you haven't assigned any value yet, not even a null. Generally, variables are undefined when you forgot to assign values or change existing code
